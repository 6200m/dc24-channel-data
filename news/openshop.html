<h1 class="auto-style1">Regarding Spot Shop Channel</h1>
<p class="auto-style2"><em><span class="auto-style3">News Article - Posted 27th 
March 2018</span></em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Today, along with Revision 400 of the Disconnect24 
Channel, you may have noticed that we removed the Spot Shop Channel button from 
the menu.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">You may be already wandering why this happened or you may 
even be mourning at the thought of it's sudden cancellation.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The Spot Shop Channel has been rebranded as The Open Shop 
Channel and will be a standalone project. This is so we can make the service as 
universal as possible, meaning that any WiiConnect24 replacement server will be 
able to use The Open Shop and publish their content to it without fears of the 
service management censoring or removing it.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">We hope to relist this service in DC24 Channel so you can 
use it freely when development is finished.</p>
